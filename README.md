# Outline

- I've always wanted to learn how to use Linux and therefore I purchased a Raspberry Pi 4 and started tinkering around. After spending a few days understanding the Linux file system, having gotten accustomed to the Windows setup, I wanted to build a fun project that would allow me to dive deeper into the pi whilst also building something that could be useful. That was when I came across [Gremson's Magic Mirror YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aa3VVZA0e5Y) and was instantly intrigued. I loved the idea of a mirror - an everyday commonplace item - being extended and made more useful by some seemingly simple tech! I had found my project and wanted to design the mirror as a gift.
- After some more research into the whole world of Magic Mirrors, I thought I would capitalise on the excellent base software already built by Michael Teeuw and a host of other enthusiasts who have made the process extremely trivial for novices like me. A comprehensive introduction to their software can be [found here](https://magicmirror.builders/). Their software essentially runs a continuous webpage that refreshes periodically and sits below a one-way mirror (more info on the hardware to follow) and the most useful part of the software is the fact that it is perfectly customizable and there is a whole host of third party modules (which can be found in the MagicMirror documentation above) that can be used to fashion a mirror based on the users needs.
