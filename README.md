# Outline:

- I've always wanted to learn how to use Linux and therefore I purchased a Raspberry Pi 4 and started tinkering around. After spending a few days understanding the Linux file system, having gotten accustomed to the Windows setup, I wanted to build a fun project that would allow me to dive deeper into the pi whilst also building something that could be useful. That was when I came across [Gremson's Magic Mirror YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aa3VVZA0e5Y) and was instantly intrigued. I loved the idea of a mirror - an everyday commonplace item - being extended and made more useful by some seemingly simple tech! I had found my project and wanted to design the mirror as a gift.
- After some more research into the whole world of Magic Mirrors, I thought I would capitalise on the excellent base software already built by Michael Teeuw and a host of other enthusiasts who have made the process extremely trivial for novices like me. A comprehensive introduction to their software can be [found here](https://magicmirror.builders/). Their software essentially runs a continuous webpage that refreshes periodically and sits below a one-way mirror (more info on the hardware to follow) and the most useful part of the software is the fact that it is perfectly customizable and there is a whole host of third party modules (which can be found in the MagicMirror documentation above) that can be used to fashion a mirror based on the users needs.
- A more detailed description about the software and hardware lies below!

# Purpose:

- Building this raspberry pi project was much easier than I anticipated and setting it up required very little programming knowledge (only limited to JS syntax info, even that was overly trivial). Although I don't usually work with hardware, I enjoyed the process immensely and was thoroughly engaged in the measurements etc. As I said earlier, this project was built as a gift and it served to be the apt introduction into the world of Linux, having to deal with some software nuances in the pi such as removing the boot page, setting up ssh and general command line operation made the project very educative and the end product turned out to be fully worth the effort!

# Description:

- First, I'll address the hardware. Please note that I am not going in depth into the construction of the frame and other hardware components as there is an abundance of better tutorials, one of which can be found [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/414647/how-to-build-a-smart-mirror/). I took to paper to draw out the frames and measurements, which I based around an old BenQ monitor that was laying around and arrived at the following initial plans - please excuse my handwriting.

- I also fashioned a 2"x2" hole in the inner frame in order to run the wiring through neatly. I found it much easier to visualise the whole process as a stack and starting from bottom to top, the build consisted of the outer frame, followed by the inner frame, then the one-way mirror, the monitor, opaque board (which replaced the opaque film) - to block light where the monitor didn't cover the mirror finally followed by the pi and the wiring (the regular power and HDMI cables).

- Note that this layout did change in the end, here are some pictures of what the final build looked like, please excuse the shaky labels and squiggly handwriting - it was my wacom not me.

- Now onto the fun bit, the software. Here too, I am not going to go into setting up the pi or downloading the MagicMirror software but rather I want to focus on the different modules that I used, resources for setting them up and finally why I chose each module. I chose not to include the built in modules that shipped with the software in this article since they have not been added by me (although these are customizable too which is mentioned in the above set-up article).

- Modules:
  - Each of the modules present below can be customized immensely, and the guides for their installation and customization can be found in the READMEs in the links attached below - otherwise StackOverFlow always serves as a great resource :).
  - The first module that I would recommend, one which I have found immense usability for, is the MMM-Remote-Control module which can be found [here](https://github.com/Jopyth/MMM-Remote-Control). This module creates a pseudo-admin interface that one could use to control their mirror once mounted as use it to hide and show modules on the go. The setup guide in the link is simple to follow along but vital as this module requires some IP-whitelisting.
  - Since my family is very fond of photography, I wanted to add the functionality of a digital photo frame to the project and I could do so using the [MMM-GooglePhotos](https://github.com/ChrisAcrobat/MMM-GooglePhotos) module! The caveat of this extremely functional module is that one has to set up the Google Photos API and access their credentials which if you have not done before can be slightly daunting but the documentation helps you along! Following the set-up, I could simply link an album from my library and that was it! My photos were now displayed.
  - The next module is called [MMM-pages](https://github.com/edward-shen/MMM-pages) which allows you to organize modules by page, thereby allowing an infinite number of modules without cramming the display. This module is extremely useful as it allows you to fix some modules that span all pages and then lets you choose modules that are specific to a page, leading to displays that can be both minimal and maximal at the same time. An important thing to note is that this module does not handle page-changing nor does it display the page that you are on - both of which can be easily accomplished manually via notifications or through other modules (which I have done).
  - An accompanying module to the previous one is [MMM-page-indicator](https://github.com/edward-shen/MMM-page-indicator). This module indicates which page you are on and is rather minimal and aesthetic.
  - The next module which I found through a [Brian Cotter video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JogbkzNnVXI) and have used immensely is called [MMM-AlexaControl](https://github.com/JoChef2/MMM-AlexaControl) which allowed me to use a spare Alexa echo-dot to control the mirror and change pages by saying "Turn on page ..." alongside a bunch of other commands. This module required a bit of tinkering to set up but it added vital usability to the build. It works by disguising certain parts of the magic mirror as WeMo plugs that the Alexa can add as a device and thus 'turn on' and 'off'.
  - Finally, the last module I used is the [MMM-Screencast](https://github.com/kevinatown/MMM-Screencast). The module enables YouTube casting from your smartphone onto your mirror making the build a perfect entertainment centre (naturally with the fuzzy display and sketchy audio) and while some other users have complained of issues with this module, it worked perfectly for me! This module does require audio so if your monitor doesn't have speakers, you have to link external speakers via the aux on the pi as the pi does not have any inbuilt!
